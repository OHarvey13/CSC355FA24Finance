# CSC355FA24Finance
Final Project for CSC 355 (Database Design and Implementation):
### Requirments for Final Project (Reference: Mrs. Ferner, UNCW Professor)
Written overview or summary of the project: its purpose (what or who could use this
database), its functionality (what questions or reports do the queries provide.) This is not just
your proposal resubmitted. Explain what the database actually does. Were there any ethical,
legal, or security issues?
2. Final conceptual E-R diagram
3. Table design, Relationships, & Data on Ada:
a. The implemented schema is correctly mapped from the Final E-R diagram.
b. Primary and foreign keys are appropriately identified and assigned.
c. Attributes are an appropriate type and size.
d. Quantity of data is sufficient to demonstrate the queries.
4. Supporting Queries and Functionality:
a. At least 10 SQL queries are demonstrated that implement the functionality
described in #1. These must include:
i. SELECT queries demonstrating: two-table join, three-table join, self-join, an
aggregate function, an aggregate function using GROUP BY and HAVING, a
text-based-search query using LIKE with wildcard(s), a subquery.
ii. One stored function, one stored procedure, and one trigger. Include
queries in your front-end that demonstrate the function and the procedure.
You do not need to include the trigger in your front-end. The queries for
the function, the procedure, and the trigger count towards the 10 required
queries.
5. A simple, web-based front-end providing links to the appropriate queries.
